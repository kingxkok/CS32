MyMap::
associate() is O(log(N)) where N is the number of Nodes 
find() is also O(log(N)) where N is the number of Nodes

AttractionMapper::
init() is O(S + A*L) where S is the number of segments 
				and A is the number of attractions 
				and L is the average length of attraction.name
getGeoCoord() is O(L + log(A)) where L is the average length of the attraction name 
								and A is the number of attractions

SegmentMapper::
init() is O((N+A)*log(N+A)) where N is the no. of segments and A is no. of attractions
getSegments() is O(log(N+A)), same N and A

Navigator::
navigate() is O((N+A)*log(N+A)), 
where N+A is the number of segments and attractions I analyze
(usually a lot less than the total in the mapdata)
